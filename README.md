# Exim.js

[hellyeah.is/exim](http://hellyeah.is/exim/)

An architecture for HTML5 apps using Facebook's Flux.js library.

Standing on the shoulders of giants

## 8 reasons why Exim

1. React.js - using the great Facebook base
2. Flux.js - new architecture from Facebook, modern replacement for MVC.
3. Intelligible React-based Router
4. Tremendeously simple structure.
5. First-class JS & coffeescript with support for short syntax.
6. Lightweight, no big dependencies.
7. Brunch, Grunt, Gulp boilerplates. Bower, NPM, Browserify, AMD & Common.js support
8. Great conventions.

## Dependencies

The only hard dependency is React.js.

Optional dependency: **Bluebird** - ultra-fast promises

## Future TODO

- Data fetcher
- Explicit state (https://github.com/dustingetz/react-cursor)
